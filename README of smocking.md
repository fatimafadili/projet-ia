## Introduction
In this project, I developed a CNN model to predict a person's smoking behavior based on images. The model was built using TensorFlow, a popular neural network library/framework, through which I leveraged its capabilities to train and optimize the model. The goal of this project is to assist public inspectors in automatically identifying a person's smoking behavior based on the images captured.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/smoking). In general, this dataset consists of images depicting people both smoking and not smoking, with the image data for training ,validation and testing

  __ building_model.ipynb = Python notebook contains scripts to build the model    
  __ README.md = Repository description
  __ requirements.txt = List of libraries required to build the CNN model

## Usage
we are going use this model CNN to detecte fatigue

## Results
The CNN model achieved a prediction accuracy of 70%, with its performance classified as 'Goodfit'. In other words, this model can distinguish images of people exhibiting non-smoking behavior with 70% accuracy.
